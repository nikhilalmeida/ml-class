    "## Artificial Neural Network and TensorFlow\n",
    "[Artificial Neural Network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network) (ANNs) are a family of models inspired by biological neural networks which are used to estimate or approximate functions that can depend on a large number of inputs and are generally unknown.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Biological Neuron\n",
    "* There are about one hundred billion neurons in human brain.\n",
    "* Brain is an extremeley interconnected networks of neurons. \n",
    "* A neuron collects inputs using a structure called dendrites, the neuron effectively sums all of these inputs from the dendrites and if the resulting value is greater than it's firing threshold, the neuron fires.\n",
    "* When the neuron fires it sends an electrical impulse through the neuron's axon to it's boutons. These boutons can then be networked to thousands of other neurons via connections called synapses.\n",

    "### Perceptron (or Artificial Neuron)\n",
    "A typical perceptron will have many inputs and these inputs are all individually weighted. The perceptron weights can either amplify or deamplify the original input signal. For example, if the input is 1 and the input's weight is 0.2 the input will be decreased to 0.2. These weighted signals are then added together and passed into the activation function. The activation function is used to convert the input into a more useful output. There are many different types of activation function but one of the simplest would be step function. A step function will typically output a 1 if the input is higher than a certain threshold, otherwise it's output will be 0.  \n",

    "#### Recurrent Neural Networks\n",
    "A recurrent neural network (RNN) is a class of artificial neural network where connections between units form a directed cycle. This creates an internal state of the network which allows it to exhibit dynamic temporal behavior. Unlike feedforward neural networks, RNNs can use their internal memory to process arbitrary sequences of inputs. This makes them applicable to tasks such as unsegmented connected handwriting recognition or speech recognition.  \n",
    "**Analogy to Human Brain**: Try speaking out loud from A to Z. When you are done, try it in reverse i.e Z to A. You will find that A to Z is a lot easier then in reverse order. This is because our entire life we have been learning A to Z and not in reverse order. So brain does some optimization on it's own and remembers the sequence. If I ask you what is fifth letter from D in correct order. It is tough to tell right away! \n",

    "#### Vanishing gradient problem and Exploding gradient problem\n",
    "The **vanishing gradient problem** is a difficulty found in training artificial neural networks with gradient-based learning methods and backpropagation. In such methods, each of the neural network's weights receives an update proportional to the gradient of the error function with respect to the current weight in each iteration of training. Traditional activation functions such as the hyperbolic tangent function have gradients in the range (âˆ’1, 1) or [0, 1), and backpropagation computes gradients by the chain rule. This has the effect of multiplying n of these small numbers to compute gradients of the \"front\" layers in an n-layer network, meaning that the gradient (error signal) decreases exponentially with n and the front layers train very slowly.  \n",
